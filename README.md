# QtSerialPortHelper
    This is a Qt-based Serial Communication Assistant designed to simplify the process of managing serial port communication.
    The application includes features for both sending and receiving data through a serial port, with flexible configuration options for the port's baud rate, data bits, stop bits, and parity. 
    It supports asynchronous multi-threaded operation for handling serial port communication efficiently.
## Features:
    1.Send and Receive Serial Communication：Supports separate threads for sending and receiving data.
    2.Serial Port Configuration:Allows dynamic configuration of serial port settings, including baud rate, data bits, stop bits, and parity.
    3.Multi-threading Support:Utilizes separate threads for serial data transmission and reception to improve efficiency and responsiveness.
    4.UI Controls: Includes a user-friendly interface with combo boxes for selecting serial port parameters, text areas for sending and receiving messages, and buttons for opening/closing serial ports.
    6.Error Handling: Provides real-time error reporting for various serial port operations.
    7.Clear Interface:Simple, intuitive interface to handle data input/output and easily manage multiple serial ports.
## How It Works:
    1.Serial Port Settings: The user can select the desired serial port and configure the port settings, such as baud rate, data bits, stop bits, and parity.
    2.Open/Close Ports:Separate buttons allow users to open and close the sending and receiving serial ports. Once the port is opened, the appropriate thread for sending or receiving data is activated.
    3.Sending Data: The user can type messages into the send text box and click the send button to transmit data via the serial port.
    4.Receiving Data:The received data is automatically displayed in the receive text box, and users can monitor the communication process.
    5.Clear Data: A button to clear the text areas for both sending and receiving messages.
## Technologies Used:
    Qt 5/6 for GUI and multi-threading.
    QSerialPort for serial communication.
    C++ for application logic and threading.
    QMutex for thread synchronization and data protection.
